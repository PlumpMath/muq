## Purely functional data structures

* [Purely Functional Data Structures (thesis)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf), by Chris Okasaki, the book of the same name is an expanded version of this
* [What's new in purely functional data structures since Okasaki](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1539/whats-new-in-purely-functional-data-structures-since-okasaki)
* [Extreme Cleverness: Functional Data Structures in Scala](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Functional-Data-Structures-in-Scala) by Daniel Spiewak (video), a nicely presented, fairly broad (lists, queues, trees, vectors) presentation about the data structures in scala (and other languages)
    - [slides](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1679797/NE%20Scala/Extreme%20Cleverness.pdf), [code in Scala](https://github.com/djspiewak/extreme-cleverness/)
    - I've [implemented](https://github.com/heyLu/lp/blob/master/hs/DataStructures.hs) some of them in Haskell
